# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

The following issues have been addressed in the authentication flow:

### 1. Race Condition in AuthBloc
- **Problem**: The auth state listener and manual state emission were conflicting
- **Solution**: Improved state management to prevent race conditions
- **Changes**: Added proper state checking before emitting new states

### 2. Missing Timeout Handling
- **Problem**: App could get stuck in loading state indefinitely
- **Solution**: Added 30-second timeout for all auth operations
- **Changes**: Added timeout timers in both AuthBloc and AuthRepository

### 3. Poor Error Handling
- **Problem**: Generic error messages and no retry mechanism
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling with specific messages and retry functionality
- **Changes**: Added detailed error messages and retry button in UI

### 4. State Management Issues
- **Problem**: UI not properly reflecting loading states
- **Solution**: Added `isLoading` getter to all auth states
- **Changes**: Improved UI responsiveness during authentication

## Debug Information

The app now includes debug logging to help identify issues:

### Console Logs to Watch For:
- `Firebase initialized successfully` - Firebase is properly configured
- `AuthBloc: Processing SignInEvent` - Login attempt started
- `AuthRepository: Attempting sign in` - Repository processing login
- `AuthRepository: Sign in successful` - Login completed successfully
- `AuthBloc: Auth state changed` - Firebase auth state updated
- `AuthBloc: Emitting AuthAuthenticated` - User authenticated

### Common Error Messages:
- `No user found for that email` - User doesn't exist
- `Wrong password provided` - Incorrect password
- `Network error` - Internet connection issues
- `Authentication timed out` - Request took too long

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Firebase Configuration**:
   - Ensure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
   - Verify Firebase project has Authentication enabled
   - Check that Email/Password sign-in method is enabled

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Try creating a new account
   - Try signing in with existing credentials
   - Check console logs for any errors

3. **Network Testing**:
   - Test with different network conditions
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check if timeout errors occur

## Common Issues and Solutions

### App Stuck in Loading State
- **Cause**: Network timeout or Firebase configuration issue
- **Solution**: Check console logs for timeout or initialization errors

### Authentication Fails Immediately
- **Cause**: Firebase not properly configured
- **Solution**: Verify `google-services.json` and Firebase project settings

### User Not Redirected After Login
- **Cause**: Auth state listener not working
- **Solution**: Check console logs for auth state changes

## Firebase Configuration Checklist

- [ ] Firebase project created
- [ ] Android app added to Firebase project
- [ ] `google-services.json` downloaded and placed in `android/app/`
- [ ] Authentication enabled in Firebase console
- [ ] Email/Password sign-in method enabled
- [ ] Firestore database created (if using notes feature)

## Performance Improvements

- Added timeout handling to prevent infinite loading
- Improved error messages for better user experience
- Added retry mechanism for failed authentication attempts
- Enhanced state management to prevent UI freezes
- Added debug logging for easier troubleshooting
